# Autoscaling Experiments with various strategies
In this experiment, we wanted to show that the workload driven autoscaling also work for larger ensemble application. 
We deployed the ensemble with 100 instance of each application. As previously, compared with static and fully automatic strategies. 

This directory contains autoscaling experiments with the strategies
- static (8, 16, 32, 64)
- Fully Automatic Autoscaling
- Workload Driven Autoscaling

Each directory contains instructions to run the application with necessary setups and the mentioned strategy.
